# Implementation Guardrails (for AI assistants)

1) Implement ONLY what is in `MUST_HAVE.md`. Stop when finished.
2) After finishing MUST_HAVE, wait for human approval. Do not proceed unless a file `APPROVED_CORE.md` exists (content: `APPROVED`).
3) When approved, pick the next item from `STRETCH_GOALS.md` in rank order and implement exactly one stretch at a time.
4) Keep the stack and contracts defined in `BUILD_PLAN.md`. Do not change schema or APIs without updating the docs and explaining the impact.
5) Prefer small, composable PRs. Each PR must include a brief “demo script” in the description.

Non-goals: adding authentication, payments, file uploads, or third-party services beyond what is explicitly listed.
